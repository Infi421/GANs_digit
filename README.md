# GANs_digit
An implementation of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
The GAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network that produces synthetic images of handwritten digits,  while discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Both of them are trained simultaneously where the generator is trying to generate images that are indistinguishable from real images, and the discriminator trying to correctly classify images as real or fake.
